# ClearVoyage Frontend

Simple Vite setup with React

## Starting it up

In order to get started with this repository you need to install `pnpm`, building with `yarn` or `npm` should work, but proceed at your own risk :-)

Simply run `pnpm install` and run the `dev` script to run locally:

```
pnpm run dev
```
